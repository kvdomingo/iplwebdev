<p><b>Instrumentation physics, laser physics, and fields &amp; particles (theoretical physics)</b> were the three research programs of particular concern when the <b>National Institute of Physics</b> was established in <b>1983</b> as a constituent unit of the <b>College of Science, University of the Philippines Diliman</b>.  The <b>Instrumentation Physics Laboratory (IPL)</b> is where most of the instrumentation physics research initiatives in NIP are being carried out. Through the years the IPL has produced many PhD, MS and BS graduates in applied physics or physics who are now independent researchers and academics or technology innovators and entrepreneurs in the public and private sector.  The IPL faculty and students are doing scientific research in a wide range of topics from <b>optical instrumentation, photonics, signal &amp; image data processing, complex adaptive systems, neural networks &amp; machine learning</b>, and the <b>Philippine scientific enterprise system</b>.</p>
